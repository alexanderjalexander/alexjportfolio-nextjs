# alexjportfolio-nextjs

Rehash of my portfolio website using Next.js as the main framework to power it.

Planned updates
- Database to manage videos entered, projects, etc. (Postgres most likely)
- Blog Page (maybe?)
- Object Storage/CDN for large videos
- Admin page w/ authentication to manage database
